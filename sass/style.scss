ATTENTION:

CSS edits made here won't have any effect. Apex doesn't load the style.css file because
it loads a minified version of the stylesheet instead (style.min.css) to make your site faster.

If you want to make CSS edits to your site, use the "Custom CSS" section in the Customizer.

If you want more information about customizing Apex with CSS, check out this guide: https://www.competethemes.com/help/custom-css-apex/
